# Lessons learned (the traps)

Hard-won gotchas that have bitten production. Source of truth:
`flowolf86/.github/standards/LESSONS.md`; synced into each repo at
`.standards/LESSONS.md`. **Append new traps here, once.** Each entry: the trap,
why it bites, and the rule.

## SQLite hides backend-specific bugs — apps test on PostgreSQL only

SQLite's permissiveness previously hid bugs (`RETURNING`, `ON CONFLICT`,
`lastrowid`) that broke every write in production. **Rule:** every app test path
runs against PostgreSQL — the same backend production uses. The conftest asserts
against SQLite so it can't sneak back in.

## The reverse proxy silently swallows `/api/auth/*`

The reverse proxy (Caddy on packliste, Traefik on beikost) routes `/api/auth/*`
to the Better Auth Node sidecar (port 3000). Any FastAPI route whose path starts
with `/api/auth/` is silently swallowed in production and never reaches Python —
it works locally without the proxy, then vanishes in prod. **Rule:** keep FastAPI
routes out of that prefix — e.g. `/api/profile`, not `/api/auth/update-user`.

## Never attach the immutable static cache to the catch-all route

The `/static` router uses an immutable 1-year cache — safe only because static
URLs carry `?v={{ revision }}`, which changes every deploy. The catch-all route
must use `no-store`. **Rule:** never attach `staticcache` to the catch-all — it
would cache dynamic HTML/API responses as immutable.

## Private foundation submodule needs an SSH deploy key in CI

The auto-provided `GITHUB_TOKEN` is scoped to the current repo and cannot clone
the private `foundation-api-engine` submodule. The `.gitmodules` URL is SSH
(`git@github.com:…`). **Rule:** CI fetches the submodule with the read-only
`FOUNDATION_DEPLOY_KEY` over SSH before any build/test step.

## Client JS is never exercised by pytest — `node --check` it in CI

pytest only drives the Python backend over HTTP; it never loads `app/static/*.js`.
A syntax error there (e.g. smart-quotes mangling `i18n.js`) ships green yet breaks
the whole UI. **Rule:** `node --check` every client script in CI before the build.

## E2E (Playwright) jobs must have timeouts — a hang burns the whole budget

A Playwright e2e test can hang indefinitely in CI (observed intermittently at
~74% through the larger packliste suite; **not reproducible locally** — the suite
passes in ~2.5 min — so it's CI-environment flakiness, not a code bug). Without a
guard the job runs until the runner limit, wasting the monthly Actions budget.
**Rule:** every e2e job sets `pytest --timeout=90 --timeout-method=thread`
(via `pytest-timeout`) so a hang fails in ~90s, plus `timeout-minutes` on the job
as a hard backstop. This lives in the reusable `app-ci.yml`.

## GitHub Actions budget resets monthly

When the monthly Actions budget is exhausted, CI won't run. **Rule:** run the
suite locally (`make test` / `pytest -q`), then merge the PR manually via the
GitHub UI. CI re-runs automatically once budget returns.

## Branch protection can't be enforced on free-tier private repos

GitHub Free gives private repos no rulesets or branch protection. Squash-only and
no-direct-push-to-master are therefore convention-enforced there, backed by the
client-side `pre-push` hook. On the paid plan the server-side ruleset enforces
them for real; keep the convention so a downgrade changes nothing.

## Local linter can revert the working tree

After commits, a local linter may reset working-tree files to the last committed
state. The remote branch always has the correct content. **Workaround:**
`git stash` before branch switches; verify with `git show origin/<branch>:<file>`.

## e2e: `wait_for_url("**/")` misses the post-create redirect

After creating an entity the server redirects to `/?<param>=<id>`, not bare `/`,
so `wait_for_url("**/")` hangs. **Rule:** assert on a visible element instead,
e.g. `expect(page.locator(".card").first).to_be_visible(timeout=8000)`.

## New repos default to read-only Actions permissions — breaks release.yml silently

A brand-new repo's Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions defaults
to "Read repository contents permission" (`default_workflow_permissions:
"read"`). `app-release.yml` declares `permissions: packages: write` (needed to
push images to GHCR) — on a "read" repo this makes the whole run fail with
`conclusion: startup_failure` and **zero jobs scheduled**, no annotation, no
check-run, nothing actionable in the UI. `ci.yml`'s call to `app-ci.yml` (only
needs `contents: read`) works fine on the same repo, which makes this look
like a bad workflow file rather than a permissions setting. **Rule:** when
bootstrapping a new app repo, set this immediately —
`gh api -X PUT repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/permissions/workflow -f
default_workflow_permissions=write -F can_approve_pull_request_reviews=false`
— before wiring up `release.yml`, not after hitting the silent failure.

## VPS: redeploy config changes through release.yml, never raw `docker compose up -d` over SSH

Manually SSH'ing in and running `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f
docker-compose.prod.yml up -d` to pick up a `.env` change left two apps
(`packliste-app`, `gs-app`) crash-looping (exit code 3, dying right after the
Alembic "Will assume transactional DDL" log line, no traceback) — removing the
new env vars did not fix it, ruling out app code. Redeploying the identical
image/config through `gh workflow run release.yml -f image_tag=<current-tag>`
(clean `docker login` + `pull` + recreate via the CI runner) fixed both
immediately. Root cause was never pinned down, but the CI path is evidently
safer than ad-hoc SSH commands against shared Docker/containerd state on the
single multi-app VPS. **Rule:** to apply an env change to a running app,
`gh workflow run release.yml -f image_tag=<current-tag>` — never hand-run
`docker compose up` over SSH.
