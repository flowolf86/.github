# Lessons learned (the traps)

Hard-won gotchas that have bitten production. Source of truth:
`flowolf86/.github/standards/LESSONS.md`; synced into each repo at
`.standards/LESSONS.md`. **Append new traps here, once.** Each entry: the trap,
why it bites, and the rule.

## SQLite hides backend-specific bugs — apps test on PostgreSQL only

SQLite's permissiveness previously hid bugs (`RETURNING`, `ON CONFLICT`,
`lastrowid`) that broke every write in production. **Rule:** every app test path
runs against PostgreSQL — the same backend production uses. The conftest asserts
against SQLite so it can't sneak back in.

## The reverse proxy silently swallows `/api/auth/*`

The reverse proxy (Caddy on packliste, Traefik on beikost) routes `/api/auth/*`
to the Better Auth Node sidecar (port 3000). Any FastAPI route whose path starts
with `/api/auth/` is silently swallowed in production and never reaches Python —
it works locally without the proxy, then vanishes in prod. **Rule:** keep FastAPI
routes out of that prefix — e.g. `/api/profile`, not `/api/auth/update-user`.

## Never attach the immutable static cache to the catch-all route

The `/static` router uses an immutable 1-year cache — safe only because static
URLs carry `?v={{ revision }}`, which changes every deploy. The catch-all route
must use `no-store`. **Rule:** never attach `staticcache` to the catch-all — it
would cache dynamic HTML/API responses as immutable.

## Private foundation submodule needs an SSH deploy key in CI

The auto-provided `GITHUB_TOKEN` is scoped to the current repo and cannot clone
the private `foundation-api-engine` submodule. The `.gitmodules` URL is SSH
(`git@github.com:…`). **Rule:** CI fetches the submodule with the read-only
`FOUNDATION_DEPLOY_KEY` over SSH before any build/test step.

## Client JS is never exercised by pytest — `node --check` it in CI

pytest only drives the Python backend over HTTP; it never loads `app/static/*.js`.
A syntax error there (e.g. smart-quotes mangling `i18n.js`) ships green yet breaks
the whole UI. **Rule:** `node --check` every client script in CI before the build.

## E2E (Playwright) jobs must have timeouts — a hang burns the whole budget

A Playwright e2e test can hang indefinitely in CI (observed intermittently at
~74% through the larger packliste suite; **not reproducible locally** — the suite
passes in ~2.5 min — so it's CI-environment flakiness, not a code bug). Without a
guard the job runs until the runner limit, wasting the monthly Actions budget.
**Rule:** every e2e job sets `pytest --timeout=90 --timeout-method=thread`
(via `pytest-timeout`) so a hang fails in ~90s, plus `timeout-minutes` on the job
as a hard backstop. This lives in the reusable `app-ci.yml`.

## GitHub Actions budget resets monthly

When the monthly Actions budget is exhausted, CI won't run. **Rule:** run the
suite locally (`make test` / `pytest -q`), then merge the PR manually via the
GitHub UI. CI re-runs automatically once budget returns.

## Branch protection can't be enforced on free-tier private repos

GitHub Free gives private repos no rulesets or branch protection. Squash-only and
no-direct-push-to-master are therefore convention-enforced there, backed by the
client-side `pre-push` hook. On the paid plan the server-side ruleset enforces
them for real; keep the convention so a downgrade changes nothing.

## Local linter can revert the working tree

After commits, a local linter may reset working-tree files to the last committed
state. The remote branch always has the correct content. **Workaround:**
`git stash` before branch switches; verify with `git show origin/<branch>:<file>`.

## e2e: `wait_for_url("**/")` misses the post-create redirect

After creating an entity the server redirects to `/?<param>=<id>`, not bare `/`,
so `wait_for_url("**/")` hangs. **Rule:** assert on a visible element instead,
e.g. `expect(page.locator(".card").first).to_be_visible(timeout=8000)`.
